#no-build-blog

Unlike most blogs that use services like Jekyll and Wordpress etc. This one is a bit different. Articles are written in Markdown, and dynamically added where you want in a webpage. 

This means that you can use whatever webpage or template you want, not a special theme. 
This isn't the best for everyone, if you want just a blog, not a website and a blog second, then you should probably check out [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) or [Hexo](https://hexo.io/).

It's aimed at people with a website who want a blog, not people who want a blog first and a website second.
