Want to write a tutorial?

*Good thing there is a tutorial for that then!*
To get started, make sure the tutorial you are writing works and that you have tested to prove this.

##How it works
Everything wriiten on this site is written in [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).
This makes it easy for anybody to write it. To write it you may find these resources useful 

1. [Cheatsheet](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/)

2. [Editor](https://stackedit.io/editor)

This markdown is taken from the file with JS and then embedded using [Strapdown](http://strapdownjs.com/).
