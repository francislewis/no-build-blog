##How it works
Everything wriiten on this site is written in [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).
This makes it easy for anybody to write it. To write it you may find these resources useful 

1. [Cheatsheet](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/)

2. [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/editor) (Markdown editor)

This content written in markdown is dynamically placed in the webpage using JS and then rendered using [Strapdown JS](http://strapdownjs.com/).
