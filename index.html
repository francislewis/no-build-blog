#How-to
Quite a few times I have found myself searching the internet tirelessly trying to find an answer to my questions.
So, I made this site to try and help others find solutions to the answers I couldn't find.

#Technology 
Most of these tutorials will be for tech related things, this is simply beause that is an area that I run into a lot
of problems in. It won't be all tech stuff, but a lot will.
